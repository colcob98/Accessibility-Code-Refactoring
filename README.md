# Accessibility Code Refactoring for Horiseon Digital Marketing Agency

This was an exercise in refactoring the code in the homepage for Horiseon Digital Marketing Agency with the goal of meeting basic accessibility standards and thereby improving its search engine optimization (SEO).

This was done primarily through the changing of non-semantic elements for semantic ones and the addition of image alt text.
